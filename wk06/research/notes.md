**Context**: Uses task manager when has a lot of things to do, often prefers dark mode 
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: “Last month. I remember thinking about how easy it was to organise my tasks. I prefer dark mode, and because I usually struggle with organisation on a daily basis, it was actually quite helpful. It could do with access to my calendar though — that would make planning smoother.”

**Themes**: organisation, dark mode, feature gap, planning, accessibility preference

**Observations**:  Participant expressed frustration too much time to add tasks

**Themes**: Overwhelm, forgetting

**Themes**: Overwhelm, forgetting

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**: Yes, I wanted to apply to a program I was really interested in, I had a lot on my mind so I forgot to add it to my task list.

### FollowUp: How did that make you feel?
**Response**: It made me feel very upset and stressed as it was an important deadline 

**Observations**:  Participant expresses feeling upset of forgetting important tasks
**Themes**: Forgetting

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: Yes, if im walking around i will often use my phone or when I had a problem where my trackpad wasn't working i was having to use my keyboard for most things which I found very frustrating because it just doesn't work as well.

### FollowUp: What specifically doesnt work as well with a mouse?
**Response**: Dragging or selecting things is a lot more difficult without a trackpad. Navigating apps using just the keyboard feels slow and very restricted. When I use my phone, some tasks are easier, but stuff like multitasking or working across multiple windows pretty much doesn't work. Everything feels less smooth and more time-consuming.

**Observations**: Participant relies heavily on mouse. When using a keyboard, they experience less smooth experience, difficulty selecting items slower interaction. This indicates accessibility challenges. 

**Themes**: Lack of accesibility adjustments

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: I suppose in bright sunlight, when walking around during the day.

### FollowUp: How do you find that? and how 

**Response**: Usually quite annoying, i find myself having to use my hand to block out the sunlight, quite hard to see the screen.

**Observations**:  Sun affects visibility, participant mentions it being very hard to see the screen outdoors even with the use of dark mode.

**Themes**: Visual accessibility issues

---
### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: "Sometimes when I add a task i forget to press enter or like i am not real sure if its been added so having some sort of confirmation would be really helpful”

**Observations**: Participant would like some sort of confirmation message when a task has been added

**Themes**: Ease of use, Confirmation
