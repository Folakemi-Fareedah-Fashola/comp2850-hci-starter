# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Just Keyboard for managing tasks
**Situation**: When I'm using my laptop without a functioning trackpad or mouse (e.g., on a train or when my trackpad breaks)
**Motivation**: I want every core action in the task manager to be accessible through the keyboard.
**Outcome**: So I can still navigate, add tasks, and organise my work smoothly
**Underlying need**: Because relying solely on mouse-based interactions creates friction and blocks users with motor or situational limitations
**Evidence**: Participant A (line ~87: “I had to use my keyboard for most things which I found very frustrating”), Participant B (line ~125: “I just use my phone… it feels restricted”)
**Inclusion risk**: Keyboard-only users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: S1: Keyboard access → 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

## Story S2: Outdoor Visibility
**Situation**: When I am outside and its very sunny, its quite hard to see
**Motivation**: I want to be able to adjust the brightness and contrast so i can see better outside
**Outcome**: So I can use my task manager outside conveniently
**Underlying need**: Because not being able to see means users avoid using task manager outside

**Evidence**: Participant A (L66) "i find myself having to use my hand to block out the sunlight, quite hard to see the screen." 
Participant B (Q5.L137) "Bright sunlight, yes. I use my phone walking to class sometimes, and the screen is almost unreadable so I just avoid trying outside and wait till im indoors."
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Screen reader, Low digital literacy
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: S3: Contrast → 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum (AA)

## Story S3: Confirmation Feedback
**Situation**: When I add/edit/delete task 
**Motivation**: I want some confirmation that the action succeeded
**Outcome**: So I can be sure that ive done it so im not forgetting tasks
**Underlying need**: Because not getting confirmation means there could sometimes be some uncertainty surrounding if ive added the tasks or not which can be stressful especially with a lot of tasks to add.
**Evidence**: Participant A (Q6.L74) "Sometimes when I add a task i forget to press enter or like i am not real sure if its been added so having some sort of confirmation would be really helpful”
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Screen reader, Low digital literacy
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: Confirmation → 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)

## Story S4: Prioritisation
**Situation**: When I have a long lists of tasks and a lot of deadline coming up 
**Motivation**: I want the task manager to automatically sort urgent tasks according to when they need to be completed by
**Outcome**: So I can quickly decide what need doing first without stress 
**Underlying need**: Because having a long unordered list can cause stress and anxiety 
**Evidence**: Participant A (Q2.L110 "When tasks pile up, I cant tell what's urgent or what i need to do first because the task manager just puts in all together in a list so it really stresses me out")
(Q6.L145 "Being able to add when tasks can be completed by, so it can be prioritised for me")
**Inclusion risk**: Overwhelm , Cognitive load
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**:

## Story S5: Reminders
**Situation**:When I procrastinate to complete things later, there's no reminder for me when the deadline is very close
**Motivation**: I want the task manager to remind me of very urgent deadlines 
**Outcome**: So I can avoid forgetting tasks
**Underlying need**: Because no reminders leads to users forgetting their tasks and not completing them 
**Evidence**: Participant B (Q3.L118 "Yes I had an assignment that I was supposed to complete but i decided to wait till later and ended up forgetting")
**Inclusion risk**: People that forget stuff easily
**Type**: Job story
